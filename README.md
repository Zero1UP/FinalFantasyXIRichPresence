## How to use
Run this before starting the game as it does require admin permissions (POL runs as admin when playing through windower)

## Updating Offsets
With the release of 1.1.0 I have changed the program to read from the Offsets.json file rather than have to compile a new build everytime the game updates. 
All you have to do is find the new offsets and replace them in the json file. Make sure that they start with 0x.
